# SongLibrary
cs213 collaborative project 1

This was a collaborative project consisting of myself and Connor Magee. The purpose of this project was to create a Song Library GUI using JavaFX with an FXML file. The GUI includes a ListView of the songs along with Text Fields and Buttons to add CRUD functionality.

A JSON file is used to store the data of the song library.
